I work for a NYC government agency that is currently revamping data collection and management. I heard python is a good tool for analyzing data and thought I'd give it a try. I'm also curious about things.
I hope I can grasp coding in python enough to use it in my work - maybe continue on to the next level and learn event more. 
My high school aged son and husband recommended I read Ready Player One and much to my surprise I'm enjoying it.
I don't really have a favourite move.  I enjoy "caper" type films - no one dies and people use their wits.
Don't have one at the moment.
